nice this is looking really good... doesn't even need much changes. Just a few things:

1. Can we take off any text or images that relate to torrent/p2p ? Google has hit us with "enabling dishonest behavior" for having this on our landers a few times in the past
2. Can we add the footer links and terms from https://hotbotvpn.com/apps to this page? homepage link, about us, terms, privacy, etc.
3. Add a terms and privacy link in the text under the submit button on the free account overlay (same as /apps)

then i still have a few more, but i'll make some screenshots with changes quick, will be easier
